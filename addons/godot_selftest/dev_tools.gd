extends Node

## Generic DevTools autoload providing a file-based command interface for
## automation, testing, and CI. Commands are read from a JSON file on disk,
## dispatched to registered handlers, and results written back.
##
## This is the game-agnostic core of the godot_selftest harness. It ships only
## engine-generic verbs (ping, screenshot, scene tree, state/method access,
## action + touch input simulation, time stepping, engine feature flags,
## scene/UI validation, ...). Project-specific verbs live in a
## registry extension script (see devtools_config.json -> "extension_script")
## that implements `register_commands(dev: Node) -> void` and calls
## `dev.register_command(action, handler)` for each verb it adds. Because the
## extension loads AFTER the generic handlers, a project may override a generic
## verb by registering the same action string (last-writer-wins).

# harness-version: 0.23.0
# --- Constants ---

## Version of the godot-selftest-harness these files were copied from. Reported by the
## `harness_version` verb and stamped into every copied tool script, so a gap logged
## against a project can name the version it was seen on, and a refresh can tell a
## stale file from a customized one. Bump with .claude-plugin/plugin.json.
const HARNESS_VERSION: String = "0.23.0"

## Default bus filenames. With a session id (see _resolve_session) the id is spliced in
## before the extension, so two instances can each own a bus in the same user:// dir.
const COMMANDS_PATH: String = "user://devtools_commands.json"
const RESULTS_PATH: String = "user://devtools_results.json"
const LOG_PATH: String = "user://devtools_log.jsonl"
## Bus-identity record (G-009): written at _ready with this instance's pid, start
## time, project name and session, so a client can tell WHO owns the bus it is
## polling instead of guessing from a silent timeout.
const OWNER_PATH: String = "user://devtools_owner.json"

## Command-line flag and environment variable that name this instance's bus.
const SESSION_ARG: String = "--devtools-session"
const SESSION_ENV: String = "GODOT_DEVTOOLS_SESSION"

## Absolute directory to put the bus files in, replacing user://. Godot has no
## command line switch for user:// and honours no GODOT_USERDATA, so `launch
## --isolated` used to print a temp dir the game would never write to and then a
## follow-up command that could not work -- which reads as success and cost three
## sessions before it was believed (gather:G-091, G-111, G-115). The bus is the
## part that actually has to be isolated for two instances to coexist, and the bus
## is entirely ours, so this moves it. Saves and screenshots still go to the real
## user:// -- see _cmd_ping's bus_dir field, which reports exactly what was used.
const BUSDIR_ARG: String = "--devtools-busdir"
const BUSDIR_ENV: String = "GODOT_DEVTOOLS_BUSDIR"

## Breadcrumb naming the verb currently being served, written before dispatch and
## left behind if the process dies inside a handler (gather:G-103). A project verb
## took the game down and the only evidence was the last line of the log, which
## says what STARTED, not that it never finished.

const CONFIG_PATH: String = "res://addons/godot_selftest/devtools_config.json"

## Frames to let elapse after _ready() before sampling the orphan-node baseline, so
## the main scene has finished coming up. ~0.5s at the default 60 FPS.
const ORPHAN_BASELINE_FRAMES: int = 30

## Hard ceiling on a single step_time request. The bridge serves one command at a
## time, so a typo'd "seconds" would otherwise wedge it for as long as the typo says.
const STEP_TIME_MAX_SECONDS: float = 60.0

## How long a single dispatch may hold the re-entrancy guard before the guard is
## force-released (H-038). This is a deadlock escape, NOT a command timeout: the
## handler is not cancelled (GDScript cannot), it is simply no longer allowed to
## keep the bus deaf.
##
## The ceiling has to clear the longest LEGITIMATE handler or it would reintroduce
## the overlap it exists to prevent -- step_time alone may run 60s, and validate_all
## over a large project has been measured near 90s. 300s is well past both, which is
## the correct bias: a live-but-slow handler must never trip this, while a handler
## killed by a runtime error mid-await (which never resumes, so it never clears the
## guard) must not brick the bus until the game is restarted.
const DISPATCH_WATCHDOG_MSEC: int = 300000

## Every check the `findings` verb aggregates, in report order. Named here rather
## than implied by the loop so the reply can carry a denominator: "reports clean
## while doing nothing" is this repo's documented failure mode, and a consolidated
## report is the easiest place for a check to disappear from without anyone
## noticing. Every id below ends up in exactly one of data["checks_run"] /
## data["checks_skipped"], and the client prints both. These ids are also the
## `source` values on the findings themselves and the keys of data["counts"].

## Registers a handler for a bus action. Last writer wins, so a project's
## extension may override a generic verb by re-registering its action string.
## Handler signature: func(args: Dictionary) -> Dictionary returning exactly
## { "success": bool, "message": String, "data": Dictionary }.
##
## Guidance for SETTER verbs: leave the system in a state the game itself can reach.
## A debug verb that writes one half of an invariant pair is a latent trap. It
## manufactures a state no real play session can produce, so whatever you observe
## afterwards is the behavior of an impossible state -- and the verb rots silently
## the moment anything starts reading the other half. (Real case: a set_combo that
## wrote the combo count but not the combo window. It looked fine while the HUD drew
## the count unconditionally, and became useless the day the readout began fading on
## the window timer. Nothing announced the change.) If the value you are writing has
## a partner -- a timer, a window, a flag, a matching entry in some registry -- write
## the partner too, or better, route the write through the same method the game
## itself calls.

## Use it for the handful of facts that decide whether a reading means anything at all
## — typically "is the thing under test still alive/running". Without it, a session
## that has silently entered a dead or frozen state keeps answering every query with
## well-formed zeros, which reads identically to a genuine all-clear result. Keep the

## Resolves this instance's bus id from `--devtools-session <id>` (after a bare `--`)
## or the GODOT_DEVTOOLS_SESSION environment variable, the flag winning. Empty means
## the shared default bus, which is exactly the old behavior.
##
## Why: the bridge is one command file and one result file in one user:// directory, so
## a second running instance answers the first client's commands and neither notices.
## That makes parallel runtime verification impossible - agents working concurrently
## have to be forbidden from launching the game at all. A session id gives each instance
## its own pair of filenames, so N instances can share a user:// dir without crossing.
##
## The id is sanitized to [A-Za-z0-9_-] because it becomes part of a filename; anything
## else is dropped rather than escaped, and an id that sanitizes away is ignored.

## Reads a node's state. Two deliberate departures from a plain property dump:
##
## 1. args["properties"] -- an Array of property-name Strings (a bare String is also
##    accepted) -- narrows the response to just those properties. An unfiltered read
##    of a Label is ~120 keys and of a typical game node ~200, which is a lot of
##    tokens to grep for one number. A requested name the node does NOT have is
##    listed in data["missing"] rather than silently dropped: a silent omission is
##    indistinguishable from "the value happens to be absent", which is exactly how
##    the transform bug below stayed invisible for weeks. The read itself still
##    reports success -- probing for an optional property is a legitimate use -- so
##    check data["missing"], which is always present when a filter was supplied.
##
## 2. data["transform"] is ALWAYS present, filter or no filter, and is read straight
##    off the node instead of through get_property_list(). This is not redundancy.
##    Godot clears PROPERTY_USAGE_STORAGE on position/rotation/scale/pivot_offset for
##    the children of a Container, so the enumeration above cannot see them at all --
##    a scale animation on a VBoxContainer child is completely absent from the dump
##    while working perfectly on screen. (Verified on 4.7.1: a Label under a plain
##    Control reports scale with usage 6; the same Label under a VBoxContainer
##    reports it with usage 0x10000004, which fails the filter.) Controls also expose
##    offset_transform_scale, which stays 1.0 while the node visibly scales, so the
##    enumerated dump can be actively misleading. data["transform"] is the value to
##    assert on. Requesting "transform" in args["properties"] is accepted and never
##    counts as missing.
##
##    Note: data["transform"] shadows the engine's own raw `transform` property (a
##    Transform2D / Transform3D) on nodes that have one. Nothing readable was lost --
##    that property carries usage 0 and so never passed the filter anyway.

## Collects engine metrics. Beyond the absolute counters it reports orphan GROWTH
## against a baseline sampled at startup (see _capture_orphan_baseline), because the
## absolute orphan count is not a number a project can be held to.
##
## args["reset_baseline"] = true re-samples the baseline from the current count
## before reporting, so growth is measured from here on. Call it once the game has
## reached the state a run actually starts from -- typically right after /verify's
## entry hook -- otherwise the scene load itself dominates the delta.
##
## args["frames"] (int, default 30): FPS is MEASURED over this many frames by
## wall clock and reported as fps (the mean), fps_min, fps_max, fps_samples,
## fps_window_sec, plus fps_settling when the second half of the window ran
## more than 15% faster or slower than the first (moving-in:G-021, seen twice: a
## single Engine.get_frames_per_second() read straight after a quality-preset
## switch produced HIGH 110 / MEDIUM 50 / LOW 105 - a ladder that would have
## reported the slowest preset as the fastest - and a shadow toggle read as
## 70 -> 37 where a controlled A/B says the cost is 2 fps). frames = 0 gives the
## old instantaneous read; fps_instant carries it either way. Wall clock, not
## process delta, so a leftover set_game_speed cannot stretch it.
##
## Node growth (moving-in:G-030): a node parented under a live node is never an
## orphan, so a UI that adds a layer per visit or a pool that grows per spawn
## reports orphan growth +0 forever. node_baseline / node_growth are sampled and
## reset alongside the orphan baseline; args["by_type"] = true adds
## node_types_delta = { class: +N } for every class whose live count changed
## since the baseline, which turns "something accumulates" into "3 more

##  * A game that hides its touch UI behind DisplayServer.is_touchscreen_available()

## Advances the running game by (approximately) `seconds` of game time, so a tween or
## animation can be sampled at a chosen moment instead of wherever a real-time sleep
## happened to land. args: { "seconds": float }.
##
## READ THE LIMITS BEFORE TRUSTING A SAMPLE TAKEN THIS WAY.
##
##  * There is no manual tick. GDScript cannot drive SceneTree iterations, so there
##    is no "advance the world by exactly N seconds and stop" primitive to build on.
##    This verb runs the game at normal speed and returns once enough time has
##    passed. The tree is NOT paused and NOT stepped, despite what the name suggests.
##  * Engine.time_scale is pinned to 1.0 for the duration and restored afterwards, so
##    a leftover `set_game_speed 0.05` cannot silently stretch the interval. That
##    pinning is the part that makes repeated samples comparable.
##  * PHYSICS IS EXACT. Physics deltas are fixed at 1/physics_ticks_per_second, so
##    advancing N physics frames advances physics-driven state by exactly
##    N/physics_ticks_per_second seconds. data["physics_seconds"] is that number and
##    it is the one to trust. A Tween created with TWEEN_PROCESS_PHYSICS, or an
##    AnimationPlayer set to ANIMATION_PROCESS_PHYSICS, lands on it.
##  * PROCESS IS NOT EXACT. Tween defaults to TWEEN_PROCESS_IDLE and AnimationPlayer
##    to ANIMATION_PROCESS_IDLE; both advance by the real frame delta, which is
##    wall-clock and jittery. This verb therefore also accumulates the process deltas
##    it actually observed and reports them as data["process_seconds"]. The sample
##    lands within roughly one frame (~16 ms at 60 FPS) of the requested moment, not
##    on it. Compare process_seconds against seconds_requested rather than assuming
##    they match; for a tighter sample, drive the tween off physics.
##  * A paused tree still emits process/physics frames while nothing in the game
##    advances, so this would happily "step" a frozen game. data["tree_paused"] says
##    whether that happened -- check it before concluding the animation did nothing.
##  * The loop has a frame budget so a starved or stalled tree cannot wedge the
##    single-in-flight command bus. data["budget_exhausted"] reports it and the
##    command returns success:false.

## Screen-space rect for ANY CanvasItem, not just a Control.
##
## `node-bounds .../Sprite2D` used to answer `Node is not a Control`, so every
## visual check on a game object meant reconstructing the camera transform by
## hand -- `(world - player) * zoom + viewport/2`, three devtools calls and an
## assumption that the camera is centred on the player (gather:G-120). A
## CanvasItem already knows its own answer:
## get_global_transform_with_canvas() is the same transform the renderer uses,
## so it accounts for the camera, every ancestor's scale, and the CanvasLayer.
##
## Both branches go through that transform. A Control used to take its own
## get_global_rect() instead, which stops at the CanvasLayer -- so this verb
## contradicted the paragraph above for exactly the nodes most likely to sit on a
## scaled layer (gh#2). For any other CanvasItem
## the rect is derived from the canvas transform, sized from whatever the node
## can report (a Sprite2D's texture rect, a CollisionShape2D's shape) and
## degenerate (w=h=0) when it can report nothing -- an origin point is still a
## useful answer to "where on screen is this", and a zero size says plainly that
## the extent is unknown rather than inventing one.
##
## CanvasItem-only by construction -- there is no screen rect for a
## MeshInstance3D. `aabb` is the 3D counterpart, in world units.

## Merged WORLD-SPACE AABB of everything a node draws -- the 3D half of node-bounds.
##
## node-bounds is CanvasItem-only, so a 3D project could not ask the harness where
## anything IS: `node-bounds /root/House/Living/tableCoffeeGlass` answered "Node is
## not a CanvasItem, so it has no screen rect". The gap was logged three times
## across two logs before it was closed (moving-in:G-002, moving-in:G-006), and in
## between it produced a real shipped defect -- a book placed 4cm past the edge of
## the table it was supposed to rest on, caught only by a screenshot -- plus about
## 25 lines of hand-rolled glTF arithmetic written twice in one session. `top_y` is
## here because the recurring question is not "how big is it" but "what do I rest
## something on".
##
## Light3D is EXCLUDED, and that exclusion is the whole reason this is a walk and
## not a one-liner. Light3D extends VisualInstance3D, so "merge every
## VisualInstance3D" quietly includes it, and an OmniLight3D's AABB is a cube of
## TWICE ITS RANGE: a 0.2-unit lamp with a light child measured 7.2 x 7.2 x 7.2 and
## corrupted every top_of() / center_of() derived from it. Only GeometryInstance3D
## descendants are merged (MeshInstance3D, MultiMeshInstance3D, CSG shapes, Label3D,
## Sprite3D, GPUParticles3D) -- the set that actually draws geometry. Everything
## skipped is named in data.excluded with the reason, so a surprising number can be
## traced without a second call.
##
## A node with NO geometry FAILS rather than returning a zero AABB at its origin: a
## zero AABB reads exactly like an honest measurement of a tiny object sitting right
## there, and this verb exists to be trusted for placement arithmetic.
##
## The AABB is axis-aligned in WORLD space, so a rotated object reports its enclosing
## box, not its footprint. data.node_transform carries the node's own rotation and
## scale (and `axis_aligned`) so a caller can tell those two cases apart.

## Casts a ray through the 2D physics space and reports what it hit.

## one physics layer. Every project that needed it wrote its own `los_probe`
## (gather:G-136). Note the engine's own sharp edge, which this verb inherits and
## the message names: a ray STARTING INSIDE a shape reports nothing, so five
## bisecting probes can all come back `clear` while a wall sits between them.
##
## Dimension is decided by the coordinates (moving-in:G-023): [x,y] queries the
## 2D space, [x,y,z] queries the 3D space, and data.space says which. Before

## bug that did not exist. A 2D query is now REFUSED when the 3D space has
## bodies and the 2D space has none, naming the fix; a verb that answers

## Every check the harness can run against a live game, in one call, normalized
## into one flat findings list. Zero config, zero assertions, one exit code.
##
## Why this exists: each individual verb answers a different question in a
## different shape -- validate_ui returns `issues`, reachable_ui returns
## `controls` with two "unreachable" flags buried in them, performance returns
## eighteen metrics of which two are thresholded, validate_all returns a
## per-scene tree. Getting a single "is anything wrong" answer meant five calls
## and five bespoke readers, so in practice it meant one call and four checks
## nobody ran.
##
## Nothing here re-implements a check. Each branch calls the existing `_cmd_*`
## and normalizes its reply, so a fix to validate_ui is a fix here too and the
## two can never drift into disagreeing about the same scene. The one new check
## is `signal_unconnected` (see _collect_unconnected_signals).
##
## checks_run / checks_skipped are the point as much as the findings are. A
## consolidated report is where a check that silently did nothing looks exactly
## like a check that passed, so a check that could not run says so by name and
## reason, and the client prints the denominator. Sub-conditions that were
## skipped inside a check that DID run are reported with a dotted id
## ("performance.orphan_growth"); the client counts only dotless ids toward the
## denominator.
##
## args: { "scenes": bool (default true -- the slow one, it loads every scene),
##         "use_baseline": bool, "baseline_write": bool } -- the last two pass
## straight through to the UI findings baseline.
##
## data keys: findings (Array of {source, code, severity, path, message} -- a
## geometry finding measured headless also carries caveat), counts (source ->
## int), checks_run (Array[String]), checks_skipped (Array of {check, reason}),
## viewport {w, h}, baseline_in_use, new_count, pre_existing_count,
