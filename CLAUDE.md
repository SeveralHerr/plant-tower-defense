# Workflow
Look in todo.md and add it to your todo list tool, then complete every item in the list" Then inside the markdown make the last item add cool new features to your kanban.md and then replace your current todo list with the items in todo.md. Once  you reach a good milestone or vertical slice, clear the session and continue. 

# Project Instructions for AI Agents

This file provides instructions and context for AI coding agents working on this project.

<!-- BEGIN BEADS INTEGRATION v:1 profile:minimal hash:6cd5cc61 -->
## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.

## Self-Test Harness (godot-selftest-harness)

This project ships a **self-test harness**: a file-based DevTools bridge (control a
running game from the CLI), headless lint + unit-test runners (no game needed), and a
diff-aware **`/verify`** pre-commit gate. It is game-agnostic; project-specific behavior
is discovered at runtime or read from the config file below.

### DEVELOPMENT RULE (REQUIRED)
After **any** gameplay, script, or scene change, run **`/verify`** before considering the
work complete — don't wait for a commit request. It runs lint + tests, launches the game
muted, and asserts your actual diff at runtime (catching errors lint/tests can't).
Headless lint and unit tests need **no running game**; run them anytime:

```bash
python tools/name_check.py                                       # names only — no engine at all
godot --headless --path . --script res://tools/lint_project.gd   # UID + scene + dup-id lint
godot --headless --path . --script res://tools/run_tests.gd      # unit tests (test_dir)
godot --path . --script res://tools/capture.gd -- --scene res://ui/hud.tscn --out shot.png
```

**`capture.gd` screenshots one scene without the bridge or a running game** — note the
missing `--headless`. Headless has no renderer (`root.get_texture()` is null), so a
headless run exits `2` naming the fix rather than writing a blank PNG. Flags:
`--scene` (default: main scene), `--out`, `--frames N` (default 3 — **two is the floor**
for `Control`s, since `@onready` and container sizing happen on the first frame),
`--size WxH`, `--fail-on-uniform`. Every run prints the **distinct colours sampled**;
a `WARNING: single flat colour` means the scene may have drawn nothing. For a *live*
session mid-play use the bridge's `screenshot` verb instead.

**`name_check.py` is the only gate that is safe to run in parallel.** It resolves types,
`class_name`s, autoloads, `preload("res://…")` targets, engine classes/members and string
method names from source plus a cached engine API index — it opens no project and writes
nothing to `.godot/`, so N agents can run it at once on one checkout. It is also the only
Phase 1 gate that works in a **fresh worktree**: with no class cache, lint reports a
thousand `Identifier "X" not declared` errors and still exits `0`, and the test runner
prints `[PASS]` for tests whose first statement errored.

**A clean `name_check` is not a compile.** It resolves names; it does not type-check.
`var kids := root.get_children()` where `root` is only typed `Node` is a hard parse error
— `Cannot infer the type of "kids" variable because the value doesn't have a set type` —
and `name_check` reports `errors: 0 | warnings: 0` on it, because every name in that line
resolves. Only `import_check.py` and `lint_project.gd` see that class of error, and
neither is safe to run in parallel. So if `name_check` was the only gate you were allowed
to run, hand the work back saying that — not "verified". The tool prints this itself as a
`NOT COVERED:` line on every clean run.

Exit `0`/`1`/`2` as below. Flags:
`--only PREFIX` (report just your files; the whole project is still scanned so cross-file
names resolve), `--strict`, `--json`, `--baseline PATH` / `--baseline-write PATH`,
`--no-strings`. If it prints `engine index: NONE` the engine-name half was **skipped, not
passed** — run `python tools/name_check.py --refresh-api` once (Godot in a temp dir, no
project, safe alongside other agents); `--require-api` makes a missing index an exit `2`.

Exit codes (both): `0` pass, `1` findings, `2` **the runner couldn't run** — a `2` means you
verified nothing. Redirect to a file and read it back; the Windows Godot build often prints
nothing to the console, so a failed run looks like silent success.
Test flags (after `--`): `--filter NAME` (matches method name **or** test script filename),
`--file NAME` (one script; combines with `--filter` via AND), `--json`. **Every** run prints
`Selected: N of M discovered`, `Autoloads: N of M ready` and `Assertions: N executed` — read
those lines, not just the exit code. `Total: 0 | ALL TESTS PASSED` is this harness's worst
failure mode and those three denominators are what make a silent zero visible. A selector
matching nothing is exit `2` (`SELECTED NOTHING — …`), and a suite with no `test_*` methods is
exit `2` as well; neither is a pass.
A test that returns pass having executed **none** of its own `_T.assert_*` calls prints
`[VACUOUS]` and fails the run. The usual cause is a loop over a collection that was empty —
an empty collection satisfies every assertion inside a loop over it. Fix the data, not the
test. (`Autoloads:` exists because that empty collection is usually an autoload: `--script`
mode parents autoloads to root but does not step the tree, so `_ready()` had not run. The
runner awaits a frame first, so what you test is what ships.)
`UIDs: OK` covers both halves: no stale `uid=` reference **and** no `.gd` missing its
`.uid` sidecar. A script you just wrote outside the editor has none — commit the sidecar
Godot generates alongside the script.
Lint flags (after `--`): `--strict` (warnings fail), `--baseline-write PATH` /
`--baseline PATH` (split findings into `NEW` vs `PRE-EXISTING` so repo debt isn't re-triaged
by hand), `--find-orphans` (public functions called only from tests — advisory),
`--no-shaders` (skip the shader pass).
Lint also **compiles every `.gdshader` and every `Shader` embedded in a `.tres`** and prints
`Shaders: N of M compiled OK (X file, Y embedded)`. Read the denominator: `Shaders: none
found` means there are no shaders, not that shaders passed, and `.gdshaderinc` files are
reported as *skipped* (no `shader_type`, so they're checked through their includers). This is
the only gate for a broken shader — the scene holding one loads clean, lints clean and tests
green, and shows magenta only on screen.

**Writing tests.** Alongside `_T.assert_*`, use `await _T.instantiate_ui(scene, Vector2i(w, h))`
/ `_T.free_ui(node)` for anything `Control`-shaped: headless pumps no frames, so without it
`size` stays `(0, 0)` and `@onready` vars never initialize. Test methods may `await`.
**Always read stderr**: a runtime error inside a test aborts only that method and returns
`""` for a `-> String` test — identical to a pass. `[ERR]` lines are the only signal.

### DEVTOOLS LOG (REQUIRED)
At the end of **every** response, append an entry to `log-devtools.md` (create it if
missing). Two required halves: **was using the harness worth it**, and **what was
missing from it**. If nothing was missing, write one explicit "no gaps this turn" line —
that is what makes an absent gap distinguishable from a forgotten log. The `Value:`
block is required either way.

```markdown
## YYYY-MM-DD — <what this response did>

- Value: **<warranted|overkill|insufficient|inconclusive>** — <one sentence of why>
  - Expected: <what you predicted runtime would reveal, written before running it>
  - Got: <what it actually told you — quote the assertion, not "it passed">
  - Found: <what this run caught that reading the diff would not have, or "nothing">
  - Cheaper: <the cheapest thing that would have given the same confidence>

- Gap: **<what was missing>** — <the command run, the output it gave, the workaround used>
  - [G-001] status: open | seen: 1 | harness: 0.7.0
  - Improvement: <the smallest change that would have closed it>
```

`warranted` = runtime produced a claim the diff could not (name it). `overkill` =
everything passed and confirmed what was already known — renames, comments, pure
refactors, anything lint alone settled. `insufficient` = it ran but never reached or
asserted what mattered (**reach decides this, not your impression**); file the gap.
`inconclusive` = aborted or too small to judge.

**`overkill` is a useful entry, not an admission.** It is also the one that goes
unwritten, because a run that passed feels like a run that helped. `Cheaper:` must name
something concrete — "reading `player.gd:40-60`", "lint alone, 4s", "nothing, this needed
the running game". "Probably still worth it" is not an answer.

**`Found:` counts a bug you fixed mid-run.** Every other field describes how the run
*ended*, so a defect surfaced at minute four and repaired by minute six vanishes: the
checks end green, the runners end clean. Write it here or it is not recorded anywhere.
"nothing" is the honest answer for a run that confirmed what you already knew, and Phase 5
turns a `warranted` with nothing found into `overkill` automatically — so padding it buys
nothing.

The `[G-NNN]` line is required and is what makes the log answerable: ids are stable and
never reused, `status:` is `open`/`fixed`/`wontfix` (`fixed` adds `fixed-in: X.Y.Z`),
`harness:` comes from `python tools/devtools.py harness-version`. **Hitting a known gap
again bumps its `seen:` count** — don't file a second entry for it. `tools/upstream_gaps.py`
reads exactly these fields to pool open gaps into the harness repo.

Quote real output; a gap without evidence can't be acted on later. This log is the
harness's feedback channel — entries here are what get upstreamed into
`godot-selftest-harness` itself, so a gap logged here becomes a fixed feature for every
project using it. A `Stop` hook (`tools/check_devtools_log.py`, wired in
`.claude/settings.json`) prints a reminder when a session changes code without touching
the log; it is advisory, not a gate.

### THE VERIFY LEDGER
`/verify` Phase 5 appends one line per run to `.devtools/verify-runs.jsonl` — including
the clean ones, which is the point. The gaps log records what the harness couldn't do;
the ledger is the denominator it lacks.

The field worth reading is **reach**: computed by intersecting the diff against the
`script`/`scene_file` paths in a `scene-tree` snapshot, so it says whether a run actually
loaded the code it claimed to verify rather than asking the run to grade itself. A pass
on an unreached file is a statement about the diff, not the running game — report it that
way. Each row also carries the `value` verdict above and **`found`** — the list of what
the run caught, `[]` when it caught nothing — so both "how often was this overkill?" and
"how often did it tell me something?" are queries rather than reading exercises. A Phase 4
check that failed and was fixed keeps `"result": "fail"` with `"fixed_in_run": true`;
rewriting it green erases the run's own evidence. `python tools/verify_ledger.py stats`
reads the history back; `reach` computes reach alone without writing a row. Commit the
ledger.

### Command cheat-sheet (`python tools/devtools.py <verb>`)
Launch first: `godot --path . --mute &` then `sleep 5 && python tools/devtools.py ping`.

| Verb | Use |
|---|---|
| `ping` | Confirm the bridge is live — reports which session answered, plus `bus_dir` and `user_dir` separately, and `tree is PAUSED` when it is. **The bridge answers while paused** (`PROCESS_MODE_ALWAYS`), so pause menus / settings / death screens are verifiable like any other UI |
| `quit` | Shut the game down; waits for the process and **exits 1 if it survived**. A survivor answers the bus alongside the next instance, and the symptom is empty replies, not an error |
| `scene-tree [--root PATH] [--depth N]` | Discover root scene name + node paths (don't assume names). Each node carries `script` and `scene_file`, so a changed file maps to the node that runs it. `--root` lists a deep subtree that would otherwise truncate |
| `find-nodes [--class C\|--group G\|--method M] [--where N=V] [--property N] [--root PATH]` | Locate nodes by what they *are*, not where they sit. `--where` is repeatable and takes dotted paths (`--where slot_data.item.name='Iron Bar'`). Usually the right verb for identifying one node in a large tree |
| `get-state --node PATH [--property N ...]` | Read a node's properties. **Always pass `--property`** — an unfiltered `Label` is ~120 keys. Repeatable; dotted paths walk into Resources and Dictionaries (`texture.region`, `slot_data.item.name`); unknown names are reported, not dropped |
| `set-state --node PATH --property N --value V` | Set raw property (bypasses setters/signals) and print the read-back. Dotted paths write through, same as `get-state` reads through (`environment.ambient_light_energy`) — note that mutates the **Resource**, so a shared material changes for every node using it. Vectors take `[x,y]`, `x,y` or `(x,y)` — write `--value=-200,-296` with an `=` when it starts with `-`, or argparse reads it as a flag. A struct component (`size.x`) is refused; set the struct whole |
| `run-method --node PATH --method N --args "[...]" [--json]` | Call a method — preferred when a signal should fire. Reports `returned_null` + `declared_return`, so a `-> void` that ran is distinguishable from a call that aborted. `--json` for a pipeable envelope |
| `press --node PATH [--toggle BOOL]` | Emit `pressed` on the nearest `BaseButton` at or under PATH — a real button press with no screen coordinates to guess. A disabled button is reported, not silently "pressed" |
| `curve --node PATH --method M --from A --to B [--step N]` | Call a pure method over an integer range and get the whole series — a difficulty ramp as one read. Capped at **500 points** |
| `raycast --from X,Y --to X,Y [--mask N] [--areas]` | What a ray would hit, with collision-layer names resolved. A ray that **starts inside** a shape reports nothing |
| `sample-pixels [--rect X,Y,W,H]` | Mean + dominant colour over a screen rect — "is it still on fire?" as numbers rather than a PNG to open |
| `reachable-ui` | Every Control a finger/cursor could actually hit now; unreachable ones are listed `OFF-SCREEN` or `BLOCKED BY <path>`, not dropped. Diff it across `set-feature --touchscreen true\|false` to catch an affordance that exists on one device only — `validate-ui` reports 0 issues for that, correctly |
| `node-bounds PATH` | Exact **screen-space** position/size (deterministic layout ground truth). Ancestor `CanvasLayer` transforms are applied, so a HUD on a scaled layer reports where it renders, not layer units. `canvas_scale` comes back with it |
| `aabb --node PATH` | The 3D counterpart: merged **world-space** AABB of a node's geometry — `min`/`max`/`size`/`center` plus `top_y` (rest something on this) and `bottom_y` (is it sunk into the floor). **Excludes `Light3D`** — an `OmniLight3D`'s AABB is a cube of twice its range and will silently inflate any measurement that includes it. Fails loudly on a node with no geometry rather than returning a zero box |
| `canvas-scale --node PATH` | Accumulated canvas scale + effective texture filter — the crisp/blurry question as one read |
| `set-resolution --size W,H` | Resize the window (honest read-back; headless may clamp) |
| `ui-snapshot` / `ui-snapshot-diff` / `save-ui-baseline` | Structured UI state vs baseline |
| `validate --scene S` / `validate-all` | One scene / every scene validation (expect 0 issues) |
| `validate-ui [--baseline-write] [--no-baseline]` | UI layout validation. Findings split `NEW` vs `PRE` against `user://ui_findings_baseline.json` (keyed on rule + node path); **only NEW ones fail**. `--baseline-write` accepts the current set — read them first, a blind write is deleting the check. A popup resting at alpha 0 or a world-space HUD is the case this exists for |
| `performance [--reset-baseline]` | FPS vs `fps_min`, orphan **growth** vs `orphan_growth_max` |
| `input press` `input release` `input tap` ACTION | Simulate input actions. `tap` releases on the NEXT frame and replies after the release, reporting `pressed_during`/`pressed_after` |
| `input clear` / `input list` / `input sequence FILE` | clear everything currently held / list the project's actions / replay a JSON sequence file |
| `input state [ACTION ...]` | Polled pressed/strength per action (all project actions when none named) — what the game is actually seeing |
| `key NAME [--count N] [--hold-frames N]` | Raw `InputEventKey` by OS keycode name (`E`, `LEFT`, `SPACE`) — for game code reading keys directly instead of actions |
| `touch press` `touch release` `touch drag` `--index N --pos X,Y` | Real `InputEventScreenTouch`/`Drag` — the only way to exercise multi-touch. A drag needs `--to`; `touch clear` / `touch list` cover the held points |
| `set-feature --touchscreen true` | Makes touch UI show itself on desktop (it hides when no touchscreen is reported). Set it **before** the scene loads. `--query` reads the flags without writing |
| `set-game-speed N` / `wait-frames N` | Speed up / advance N physics frames |
| `step-time --seconds N [--hold ACTION]` | Advance ~N game-seconds (**60 max** — longer waits are a `wait-frames` loop or `set-game-speed`) with `time_scale` pinned to 1.0. Physics exact; process tweens land ±1 frame — it does not pause and step the tree. `--hold` keeps an action pressed across the step and releases it at the end |
| `tilemap-cells --node PATH [--layer N] [--rect X,Y,W,H]` | Used cells with source/atlas ids as data (capped at 2000; pass `--rect`) — not a screenshot guess |
| `tilemap-region --node PATH --atlas X,Y [--layer N] [--source-id N]` | 4-neighbor connected components of matching cells, largest first — "is this island one landmass?" as data |
| `scripts-seen [--json]` | Every distinct script path that has entered the tree since launch; `--json` prints the full reply envelope |
| `launch [--isolated] [--no-mute] [--no-wait] [-- GODOT ARGS]` | Start the game detached (logs under `.devtools/`), waiting until the bus answers. `--isolated` = private session **and** bus dir, verified before the follow-up command prints. Everything after a bare `--` is forwarded to Godot (`-- --write-movie out/f.png --fixed-fps 30`, which needs `--no-mute`). It refuses a bus a live pid already owns unless `--allow-second-instance` |
| `clear-nodes --group G` (or `--method`/`--class`) `[--via-method NAME]` | Free matching nodes. `queue_free()` skips the game's own removal path, so a cleared enemy drops nothing and pays no xp — `--via-method die` runs it instead |
| `new-uid [--count N] [--write PATH]` | Emit a valid `uid://`, collision-checked against the project's existing sidecars. No game, no editor, no import — the way to give a script you just wrote its `.uid` |
| `screenshot [--region X,Y,W,H] [--hide NODE] [--hide-group G]` | Visual check only (`sleep 0.5`–`1` after a state change). Crop and hiding happen game-side inside one command, so a capture is reproducible and can't leave the HUD switched off |
| `list-commands` | Discover all registered verbs (generic + project). `--offline` statically parses the scripts when no game is running |
| `logs --tail N [--category C]` | Read the game's JSONL debug log directly (no bus call; works on a hung game) |
| `harness-version` | Installed harness revision (game + client). Read it once per session — it fills the `harness:` field on every gap you log. Exits 1 on a mismatch, which means a half-refreshed install |
| `cmd <verb> --args '{...}'` | Invoke any project-registered verb |

### Add project-specific debug verbs
Register domain verbs in `res://devtools_ext/commands.gd` (loaded after generic verbs,
last-writer-wins). Each handler returns exactly `{success:bool, message:String, data:Dictionary}`.

```gdscript
func register_commands(dev: Node) -> void:
    dev.register_command("spawn_enemy", func(args): 
        return {"success": true, "message": "ok", "data": {}})
```

Reach them from the CLI via `cmd spawn_enemy --args '{"count":3}'`; discover them via
`list-commands`. Use these for setup/trigger steps the generic primitives can't express.

**Attach liveness to every reply.** Register one status provider and its Dictionary is
merged into *every* response as `status` — the fact you need on every read and never
remember to ask for separately. Without it, a session that has silently died or frozen
keeps answering with well-formed zeros, which looks exactly like a clean pass.

```gdscript
    dev.register_status_provider(func(_args):
        var p = dev.get_tree().get_first_node_in_group("player")
        return {"player": "absent"} if p == null else {"player": "dead" if p.is_dead else "alive"})
```

Pair it with verbs that can *undo* the dead state (a `revive_player` that clears the
flag and leaves the death state, or a `god_mode` toggle). Restoring a health value is
usually not enough on its own — the death flag and state machine outlive it, so the
run stays frozen and unrescuable short of a relaunch.

**A setter verb must leave the game in a state the game itself can reach.** Writing one
half of an invariant pair is a latent trap — a `set_combo` that sets the count but not
the combo window tests nothing the moment the readout starts fading on that timer.

### Gotchas
- **One command at a time, enforced.** The bus is one command file / one result file.
  Requests carry an id the game echoes, so a crossed reply errors (`Crossed replies: …`)
  instead of silently returning another request's data — detection, not concurrency.
  A command sent while a handler is still running (`step_time`, `input_tap`, a project
  verb that awaits) waits on disk and runs when that handler returns; it is deferred,
  never dropped and never run alongside. So a timeout can now mean *your command never
  started* — the error says which, and naming the verb that is hogging the bus.
  For *parallel* instances give each its own bus: `launch --isolated`, or launch with
  `-- --devtools-session <id>` and call with `--session <id>`. That isolates the **bus
  only** — Godot has no switch for `user://`, so saves, screenshots, UI baselines and the
  `.godot/` import cache stay shared; `ping` reports `bus_dir` and `user_dir` separately so
  the difference is a read, not a guess. Add `GODOT_USERDATA` per instance to isolate fully.
  For parallel *validation* rather than parallel play, `python tools/name_check.py` needs
  none of this — it never opens the project.
- **`game not running` in ~2s** means a dead game *or* the wrong `user://` dir; the
  error can't tell them apart. Check `--userdata` before assuming a crash.
- **Assert transforms on `data.transform`, not the property dump.** Godot hides
  `position`/`scale`/`rotation` on container children, so a scale animation on a
  `VBoxContainer` child is invisible to a property read while working on screen.
- **A run that never changes is broken, not passing.** Check the `status` field.

### Config
`res://addons/godot_selftest/devtools_config.json` holds thresholds and hooks:
`fps_min`, `orphan_growth_max` (gate on this — `orphan_max: 0` is unreachable),
`safe_area_inset`, `mute`, `main_scene`, `entry_hook {node_path, method}` (advances past
a menu into the playable scene), `entry_points` (named alternates for scenes the default
hook can't reach), `test_dir`, `scan_root`, `hud_layer_name`, `name_check_extra_types`
(types a GDExtension registers at runtime, which the static checker cannot see) and
`name_check_ignore` (path prefixes it should skip).

### Token-aware
- Prefer `node-bounds` / `ui-snapshot` (compact, deterministic) over `screenshot`; only
  open a screenshot PNG when a genuine **visual** regression is suspected.
- `get-state` dumps ~120 keys for a `Label` — pass `--property NAME` (repeatable).
- Run `/verify` **inline**; don't wrap routine validation in subagents/workflows.
- Launch with `--mute` for automated testing.
- On Windows, probe Python by running it (`python3` may be a Store alias stub that
  exists and refuses to run).

### (Re)install
Run **`/scaffold-godot-harness`** to install or refresh the harness. Re-running it also
refreshes this very section in place (it never duplicates it).
