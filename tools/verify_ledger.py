"""Append-only record of what every `/verify` run actually did.

Installed by `/scaffold-godot-harness`; written by Phase 5 of `/verify`; read by
whoever wants to know whether the harness is earning its keep.

**Why this exists.** `log-devtools.md` records what the harness *couldn't* do. It has
no denominator: thirty gap entries tell you the harness was in the way thirty times,
not whether that was out of forty runs or four hundred. This file is the denominator —
one line per run, including the boring green ones, which are exactly the runs nobody
would otherwise write down.

**The field that matters is `reached`.** `verify.md` already tells a run to say so when
a changed script has no reachable entry point, but that confession lands in a chat
transcript and evaporates. Here it is computed instead of claimed: the scene-tree
snapshot carries each node's `script` and `scene_file` (harness 0.6.0+), and the
`scripts-seen` bridge verb (0.8.0+) accumulates every script ever attached to any node,
so reach is a set intersection against the diff rather than a self-assessment by the
thing being measured. A green run that never reached the changed code is the failure
mode this whole harness exists to make visible, and it is invisible in a pass/fail
summary.

**Two denominators.** "Changed" used to be one set: worktree edits unioned with the
branch's commits. The union is kept (old rows stay comparable), but the two are now
also computed apart: the *worktree* ratio is the honest per-session number — what this
session edited and whether this run loaded it — while the *branch* ratio dilutes one
run's contribution as the branch accumulates commits nobody expects a single run to
re-exercise.

Both `reach` and `record` print the two apart and labelled. `record` used to print only
the union, which on a branch that batches its pushes is dominated by commits no single
run was ever asked to re-exercise — a `7/13` beside a row whose real per-session number
was `1/1`. The union stays the first line and stays word-for-word; the worktree line
sits under it, and nothing stored changed, because the row has carried `reach.worktree`
and `reach.branch` since 0.8.0 (plant-tower-defense-6wfo).

**Implicit reach.** Autoload scripts (from `project.godot` `[autoload]`) and the
DevTools `extension_script` run in every launched session but own no persistent node a
snapshot can see. A changed file in that set that was not otherwise observed lands in
`reached_implicit` — credited as running, kept out of `unreached`, and deliberately not
folded into `reached`, which stays what was *observed*.

**Four things that were being scored as misses and are not.** A metric that reports a
file as unreached when it demonstrably ran does not merely lose accuracy — it teaches
its readers to discount the number, which is worse than not printing it.

* *Unit tests.* Scripts under the configured `test_dir` ran in Phase 1 and are
  structurally incapable of appearing in a scene-tree snapshot of a game session. They
  were being counted in the denominator anyway, so writing a test alongside a fix
  permanently capped the ratio below 100% — the exact opposite of the intended
  incentive. They now join `not_applicable` (sub-list `test_scripts`), the same bucket
  their own `.uid` sidecars were already landing in. Excused, not credited: the ledger
  cannot see Phase 1's results from here, so it does not claim they passed.
* *Headless tools.* Scripts under `reach_headless_dirs` (default `["tools/"]`) only ever
  run as `godot --headless --script res://tools/x.gd`. There is no node for them to be
  the `script` of, so they can never register in a snapshot no matter how thoroughly
  they ran — `lint_project.gd` and `run_tests.gd` were being charged as misses by the
  very runs they had just executed. Same bucket (`headless_tools`), same terms: excused,
  not credited. `addons/` is deliberately not covered — `dev_tools.gd` is the autoload
  and already resolves through `reached_implicit`.
* *Non-Node scripts.* A `RefCounted` helper held as a plain field, a `Resource`
  subclass, an item model — none of them is ever a node's `script`, so no amount of
  exercising them can register. A project can declare the observed Node that vouches
  for one via `reach_aliases` in `devtools_config.json` (see `_reach_aliases`). Those
  land in `reached_alias`, with the voucher recorded alongside in `reached_alias_via`,
  and never in `reached` — a declaration is a project's claim, not an observation, and
  the whole value of this field is that it does not blur the two.
* *Unreachable by construction.* `reach_aliases` above is a per-file manual opt-in, and
  so is `DevTools.mark_script_reached` — which means the ledger's honesty scaled with
  how many static utilities somebody remembered to annotate. It does not need to. A
  changed `.gd` whose `extends` chain terminates at `RefCounted` or `Object` can be
  read off disk with no engine at all, and no node can carry it, so `scripts-seen`
  could not have reported it however thoroughly it ran. Those land in
  `unreachable_static` with the reason in `unreachable_static_why`.

  **This is the split that changes what a reader DOES.** Before it, `NOT reached:
  game/game_speed.gd, game/key_binding_screen.gd` was one list. The first is
  `class_name GameSpeed extends RefCounted` and had just been driven by hand through
  1x → 2x → half → 1x with `Engine.time_scale` following; the second was a screen the
  session genuinely never opened. Identical text, opposite meanings — one says stop
  looking, the other says go and drive the game — so the line taught people to read
  neither (plant-tower-defense-v3ji).

  Applied *after* every other credit, so an observation always beats the inference.
  Excused, not credited, and named in full on the printed line: this says the run
  could not have seen the file, never that the file works.

**The NOT-reached list has a deadline, and it used to go unsaid** (plant-tower-defense-
fs2b, log-devtools.md G-136). `reached`/`unreached` is a set intersection against
whichever `--scene-tree` snapshot(s) and `--scripts-seen` capture(s) were actually
passed in — never against the session's history. Cycle 137 opened
`key_binding_screen.gd`'s screen, drove all nine of its labels, backed out to the
board, and captured `scene-tree` only after closing it: `NOT reached:
game/key_binding_screen.gd` printed, correct on its own terms and indistinguishable
from a screen genuinely never opened, for a file the session had just spent ten verbs
inside. The fix is not the snapshot mechanism (a union across repeated `--scene-tree`
captures already existed, and `--scripts-seen` already accumulates every script ever
attached to any node for the *whole* session, surviving a screen that closed before
the last capture) — it is that the printed line never said the intersection has an
evidence deadline, so a clean read of `NOT reached` was mistaken for "never opened"
when it only ever meant "not in what you handed me". The line below now says so
directly, every time the list is non-empty, rather than leaving it to be re-discovered
per cycle.

**Reach has three states, not two.** `reached N/M` is one; `reach not computed` (no
capture) is the second; and `reach: unavailable (not a git repository)` is the third,
added in 0.17.0 after a project with no `.git` was handed `reached 0/0 changed file(s)`
and a ledger row saying `reached: [], unreached: []` (moving-in:G-003). Its coverage
that run was in fact good, and nothing said so; worse, a row went into the permanent
record claiming a denominator it never had. A 0/0 reads as "nothing to check" and is
indistinguishable from a clean sweep, which is the exact failure this file exists to
prevent one level down. So the no-VCS case now carries `changed_unavailable: true` and
null buckets - the same null-means-unknown shape `stats` and older readers already skip
rather than average - and prints a line that cannot be mistaken for a score.

**The other half is whether it was worth running at all.** Reach says the harness did
something; it cannot say the something was needed. A log that only records gaps can only
ever recommend more harness — it has no vocabulary for *this task didn't need the tool*,
so a harness that is the wrong choice for half its runs would produce a tidy stream of
feature requests and never once suggest being used less. Hence `value` (one of
`warranted` / `overkill` / `insufficient` / `inconclusive`) and `cheaper_alternative`,
which names what would have produced the same confidence for less.

Those two are self-reported, and self-reports about one's own usefulness bias one way.
Four things push back: the verdict is a countable enum rather than prose; `expected` is
written before the run and copied in verbatim afterwards; and `_reconcile_value()`
downgrades a `warranted` on two independent mechanical grounds — one whose changed files
were never loaded becomes `insufficient`, one whose `found` list is empty becomes
`overkill`. None of that makes the field objective. It makes it harder to inflate without
noticing.

**`found` is the field that says what the run caught**, and it exists because every other
field in a row describes the run's *final state*. A defect found four minutes in and
fixed before Phase 5 leaves no trace anywhere else: `checks` gets written green, the
runners are re-run clean, and the row reads exactly like a run that confirmed what was
already known. The first 52 rows recorded in anger showed the cost of that — 319 Phase 4
checks with not one `fail`, zero new lint findings, zero failing tests, and 98% of runs
grading themselves `warranted` on the strength of catches that appear only as prose
inside `cheaper_alternative`. Reach says the run touched the code; `found` says the run
told you something.

Three states, and the difference between the last two is the whole point:

* a non-empty list — what this run caught, one entry each;
* `[]` — **this run found nothing**, an answer rather than a silence, and the one that
  earns `overkill`;
* `null` — not recorded. Every row written before 0.10.0 is this, permanently; `stats`
  excludes them from the rate rather than scoring them as zeros.

Four subcommands:

    python3 tools/verify_ledger.py reach  --scene-tree tree.json --scripts-seen seen.json
    python3 tools/verify_ledger.py record --scene-tree tree.json --scripts-seen seen.json --run run.json
    python3 tools/verify_ledger.py stats
    python3 tools/verify_ledger.py fixture

`record` derives the mechanical fields itself (timestamp, sha, branch, changed files,
reach) and takes only the run-specific ones it cannot know — runner exit codes, the
Phase 4 checks, duration, and the value reflection — as a JSON object from `--run` (or
stdin). Trust boundary: anything derivable is derived, so a run can misreport its own
checks but cannot misreport whether it touched the diff.

`record` **refuses** to write a row with unknown reach: with no readable `--scene-tree`
and no readable `--scripts-seen` it exits 1 and says what to pass, because a silently
null reach is the well-formed-zeros failure this file exists to prevent. `--no-reach`
is the deliberate escape hatch for aborted runs — it writes `reach: null` on purpose,
so the failure mode is a choice, not a default.

`record` also **refuses** to write a row whose `--run` omits `verdict`, or omits
`lint`/`tests` while `verdict` is anything other than `"aborted"` (plant-tower-defense-
4ulq, log-devtools.md G-137). This is the last guard before an append-only write, not
a standing checker: `tools/run_json_check.py` already names a dropped key as an
advisory finding, and a run.json missing `lint`/`tests` on an otherwise-clean pass was
recorded with both `null` anyway, permanently, because nothing made this write depend
on that finding. `REQUIRED_RUN_KEYS` is the full list this applies to; every other
accepted key (`runtime`, `duration_s`, `harness`, `expected`, `cheaper_alternative`,
`checks`, `found`, `value`) keeps its existing silent-default behaviour, because each
one has a real and common reason to be legitimately absent — see the comment beside
`REQUIRED_RUN_KEYS` for the historical evidence either way.

`reach` computes reach without writing a row, because the verdict depends on it: a run
that never loaded the changed file is `insufficient` however well its checks went, and
that has to be knowable before the row is written.

`stats` aggregates. Reach rate is the headline, broken out per harness version so a
release's effect is visible; the value mix and the collected `cheaper_alternative` lines
are the part that can tell you to run /verify less often.

`fixture` proves the required-key refusal above actually refuses — not just a nonzero
exit code, but no row appended and a message naming the missing key. KEPT, not written
and deleted; see `cmd_fixture`'s docstring for the cases and what each one asserts.

Exit codes: 0 fine, 1 bad input (or fixture failure), 2 nothing to report (no ledger yet).

    A voucher that was not itself reached credits nothing. That is the entire integrity

    THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (plant-tower-defense-v3ji). `reach` split a changed
    file two ways - reached, or NOT reached - and printed both halves identically.
    Measured on cycle 102's runtime pass: the speed button was pressed under a human
    hand and the label went 1x -> 2x -> half -> 1x with Engine.time_scale following
    each time, and the row still said `NOT reached: game/game_speed.gd`, because
    GameSpeed is `class_name GameSpeed extends RefCounted` and no node carries it.
    Sitting beside it in the same comma-separated list was key_binding_screen.gd,
    which was a REAL miss - a screen the session never navigated to.

    A file that CANNOT be seen and a file that WAS NOT loaded are opposite results.
    Only the second is a reason to go and drive the game; the first is a reason to
    stop looking. Printing them the same taught readers to discount the whole line.

    Static, no engine: the `extends` chain is read off disk. Applied LAST, after
    `reached` / implicit / alias / base, so a DevTools.mark_script_reached() call
    that made one of these genuinely observed still wins - an observation always
    beats an inference about the same file.

    Wider than the bead asked for, on purpose: it does not require `class_name`.
    `class_name` contributes nothing to the argument - `extends RefCounted` is the
    whole of it - and requiring it would leave an unnamed helper printing the same
    misleading `NOT reached` the bead was filed about.

    *which* unknown it was; it does not have to be read for the row to be read correctly
    (moving-in:G-003).

    reader that has never heard of them sees a SHORTER `unreached` list, which is the
    correct reading on its own - the files that left it were never things this run
    could have loaded. Historic rows keep the meaning they were written with: nothing
    here rewrites a row, and `stats` averages the buckets it finds.

    """Prove `record`'s required-key refusal actually refuses.

    THE DEFECT THIS EXISTS FOR (plant-tower-defense-4ulq, log-devtools.md G-137). A
    run.json missing `lint`/`tests` was recorded anyway with both null, on a run
    where both had actually gone fine -- append-only, so the row stands wrong
    forever. `run_json_check.py` already named the two missing keys as findings and
    exited 1, and that changed nothing, because nothing made `record`'s own write
    depend on it. A fixture that only checks record's exit code cannot tell "refused
    and wrote nothing" apart from "printed a warning and wrote anyway" -- both can
    exit 1 for unrelated reasons (a bad --run path, an aborted git call) -- so this
    one asserts the row count in the ledger file before and after each case, and the
    refusal message's own wording, never just the exit code.

    Driven through the real `cmd_record` over a throwaway root with no git repository
    (`--no-reach` is forced for every case, and every case is checked BEFORE reach is
    computed, so a missing .git here proves nothing about the rule under test) --
    never by poking `_missing_required_keys` directly, so deleting the call site in
    `cmd_record` fails this fixture even with the helper intact.

    Cases: `lint` absent / `tests` absent / `verdict` absent (all three refuse) /
    `verdict: "aborted"` omitting both `lint` and `tests` (writes -- the one honest
    exemption) / a fully populated run (writes clean). Every case checks BOTH that
    the file grew by exactly one line when a write was expected and by zero when it
    was not, AND that a refusal names the right key -- a rule that stopped firing for
    one case while still firing for another would otherwise leave "some case failed"
    indistinguishable from "the whole rule passed".

    mutations: `REQUIRED_RUN_KEYS = ()` -> RED, 3 of 5 (measured 2026-08-29): the
    three refusal cases all write a row instead (rows +1, want +0) and their needle
    assertion goes false in the same breath -- the aborted/complete cases are
    unaffected, which is the fixture correctly saying WHICH behaviour broke.
