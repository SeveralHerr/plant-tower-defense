@tool
extends SceneTree

## Headless expression evaluator for the godot_selftest harness (G-054).
## Run: godot --headless --path . --script res://tools/eval.gd -- --expr "1 + 2"
##
## Evaluates one Godot Expression against the project and prints the result.
## In scope:
##   - pure expressions: math, ternaries, built-in types and their methods
##     (Vector2(3, 4).length()), @GlobalScope functions (clamp, deg_to_rad, ...)
##   - global classes (class_name): every identifier in the expression that
##     names a registered class is bound to its loaded script, so constants and
##     STATIC functions resolve - `Balance.xp_for_level(3)`, and
##     `MyClass.new().method()` for instance behavior.
##   - autoloads, by node path. --script mode DOES instantiate them and DOES
##     parent them to root; what it has not done by the time _initialize() runs
##     is step the tree, so _ready() has not fired and an autoload that builds
##     its state there still looks empty. This runner awaits one frame first, so
##     `get_autoload("PlayerManager").level` reads what the game would read.
##     (The autoload's bare NAME is still not an identifier here - GDScript only
##     binds those when the engine loads a scene - hence the accessor.)
##
## Live world state is still not in scope: this opens the project, it does not
## play the game, so anything that depends on a running scene belongs on the
## DevTools bridge instead (get-state / run-method).
##
## Exit codes: 0 result printed | 1 parse or execute failure | 2 no --expr.

## Reaches an autoload by name, for use inside an evaluated expression:
##   eval.gd -- --expr 'get_autoload("BallCatalog").all_balls().size()'
##
## Autoloads are children of root in --script mode, but GDScript only binds
## their bare names as identifiers when the engine loads a scene - which this
## mode does not do. So the node is reachable and the name is not, and an
## accessor closes the gap. _initialize() awaits a frame before any of this, so
## whatever _ready() built is already there.
