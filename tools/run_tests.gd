extends SceneTree

## Generic headless unit test runner for the godot_selftest harness.
## Run: godot --headless --script res://tools/run_tests.gd
## Args: -- --json          Output results as JSON
##       -- --filter NAME   Run only tests whose METHOD NAME or SCRIPT FILENAME
##                          contains NAME (case-insensitive)
##       -- --file NAME     Run only tests from this test script. NAME may be a
##                          bare basename (test_player), a filename
##                          (test_player.gd) or any substring of the path.
##
## --filter and --file combine with AND, so `--file test_player --filter damage`
## runs the damage tests of one file.
##
## Exit codes. The runner always calls quit() with its own result, so the process
## exit code means "the tests said so" and never "Godot leaked an RID at shutdown":
##   0  every selected test passed
##   1  one or more tests failed, or verified nothing (see [VACUOUS] below)
##   2  the runner itself could not run, i.e. NOTHING WAS VERIFIED - test_dir is
##      missing, a test script failed to load / instantiate, no test scripts were
##      discovered at all, the discovered scripts held no test_* methods, or a
##      --filter/--file selected zero of the discovered tests. Treat this as a
##      broken gate, not as a test failure.
##
## That last case used to exit 0. A filter matching nothing skipped the entire
## suite and printed `Total: 0 | Passed: 0 | Failed: 0`, which is byte-identical
## to a clean pass for anything reading the exit code - and two agents in one
## session shipped work on the strength of it. A selection that selects nothing
## is now a runner error naming what it did: `filter 'spawner' selected 0 of 111
## discovered test(s)`.
##
## The reverse poisoning is also fixed (G-055): when --file/--filter is active,
## a test script that fails to LOAD but is OUTSIDE the selection no longer
## forces exit 2 over a fully passing selected subset. Such files are counted
## and printed (`Discovery errors: N (unselected; not affecting this run's
## exit)`) and the exit code is scored over the selected set only. With NO
## selector active a broken file still exits 2 - a whole-suite run genuinely
## could not run - and a SELECTED file failing to load stays exit 2 too.
##
## Every run states its denominator, selector or not (G-135):
##   Selected: 38 of 662 discovered  (file 'test_player_combat')
##   Selected: 662 of 662 discovered  (no selector)
##   Autoloads: 6 of 6 ready
##   Assertions: 1184 executed
##   Suite: 11 test script(s) in res://test/unit
## The bare run used to print only `Total: 662 | ...`, which is the same fact with
## nothing to compare it against - a discovery pass that silently found half the
## files it should have looked exactly like a full suite. `ALL TESTS PASSED` is
## now unreachable with a zero total: every way of running nothing is exit 2.
##
## Autoloads are stepped into readiness before discovery (findmyballs:G-002).
## In --script mode they are instantiated and parented to root, but the tree has
## not been stepped, so _ready() has NOT run when _initialize() begins: an
## autoload that builds its data there answers every test with an empty
## collection while lint reports every script compiled clean. One awaited frame
## fixes it; `Autoloads: N of M ready` is the receipt. See _await_autoloads().
##
## A test that returns pass having executed NONE of its own _T.assert_* calls is
## reported `[VACUOUS]` and scored as a failure. This is the other half of the
## same bug: three tests in the project that found it iterate a collection and
## assert inside the loop, and an EMPTY collection satisfies all three. The
## runner only makes this call when the method's own source contains a
## _T.assert_* call, so a project that hand-rolls its failure strings is never
## accused of anything.
##
## Windows note: the stock Godot .exe is the non-console build and prints nothing
## to a PowerShell console, so redirect headless runs to a file and read that back
## (e.g. `godot --headless --script res://tools/run_tests.gd > tests.txt 2>&1`).
##
## Test contract (unchanged from the original project runner):
##   - Test scripts extend RefCounted.
##   - They may expose optional setup() and teardown() methods.
##   - Each test_* method returns a String: "" == pass, non-empty == failure message.
##   - A reference to this runner script is injected as `_T` so tests can call the
##     static assertion helpers (assert_eq, assert_true, ...) and the headless UI
##     helpers (instantiate_ui, free_ui).
##   - setup(), teardown() and any test_* method may be a coroutine (may `await`).
##     The runner awaits every call, so plain synchronous tests that return a
##     String directly keep working unchanged. There is no watchdog: a test that
##     awaits a signal which never fires will hang the run.
##
## Known limitation, since it affects how much the exit code is worth: GDScript
## has no exception handling, and a hard runtime error inside a test method (a
## null dereference, say) aborts only that method and hands back the return type's
## default value - "" for `-> String`, i.e. a pass. The runner cannot see it. The
## error is on stderr, so redirect it and check it; assert on the value you expect
## rather than relying on a bad call to fail the test for you.
##
## Test scripts are auto-discovered by recursively scanning the configured test_dir
## (res://addons/godot_selftest/devtools_config.json key "test_dir", default
## "res://test/unit") for files named test_*.gd.

## Steps the tree once so every autoload finishes entering it and _ready() runs
## (findmyballs:G-002). Without this the whole suite tests a different program
## than the one that ships.
##
## In --script mode the autoloads ARE instantiated and ARE parented to root by
## the time _initialize() is called - but the tree has not been stepped, so
## ENTER_TREE and READY are still queued. Measured on 4.6.1:
##
##   in _initialize():   get_parent() = root, is_inside_tree() = FALSE,
##                       _ready() not run, its Array field empty
##   after 1 frame:      is_inside_tree() = true, _ready() run, field populated
##
## So an autoload that builds its data in _ready() answers with an EMPTY
## collection to every test, while lint reports every script compiled clean.
## The project that found this shipped three tests that iterate such a
## collection: an empty one satisfies all three, and they passed. That is why
## the assertion counter below exists as well as this await - the two halves of
## the same failure.
##
## Worse than uniformly-empty is what happened before: the runner awaits inside
## _run_single_test(), so the FIRST test that happened to await a frame flushed
## the notifications, and every test after it saw populated autoloads while
## every test before it saw empty ones. Suite behaviour depended on test order.
##

# ============= Headless Scene/UI Helpers (static) =============
# Called by test scripts via the _T reference. instantiate_scene() and
# instantiate_ui() are coroutines, so they must be awaited:
#
#   var ui: Control = await _T.instantiate_ui("res://scenes/hud.tscn", Vector2i(640, 360))
#   var err: String = _T.assert_eq(ui.size, Vector2(640, 360), "hud fills the viewport")
#   _T.free_ui(ui)
#   return err
#
# Why they exist: a test script is a RefCounted and never enters the scene tree,
# so a Control instantiated inside one has no viewport to anchor against. `size`
# stays (0, 0), get_global_rect() is empty, and _ready() - and therefore every
# @onready var - never fires. instantiate_scene() puts the scene into a real
# SubViewport of a known size (entering a live tree is what fires _ready() for
# the whole subtree, so no propagate_notification(NOTIFICATION_READY) hack is
# needed), then lets the main loop tick so Godot's deferred layout pass actually
# resolves anchors, offsets, container sorting and minimum sizes.
#
# instantiate_scene() hosts ANY root - Node2D, plain Node, Control - so a
# gameplay scene gets the same treatment: _ready() fires, @onready resolves,
# groups register with the tree, timers and physics tick when frames advance.
# instantiate_ui() is the same call under its historical name (kept because
# existing tests use it); free_ui() tears down either.
#
# dispatch_events(viewport, events) pushes InputEvents through the hosted
# viewport synchronously with NO frame in between - all of them land inside one
# frame, which is what lets a test distinguish event-scoped handling (one
# reaction per event) from frame-scoped handling (coalesced until the next
# process pass). Get the viewport from a hosted node via node.get_viewport().
#
# stub_siblings(node, siblings) builds the sibling neighbourhood a script
# reaches for at _ready() time (get_node("../X")) without loading its real
# scene; pre-add groups with sib.add_to_group("g") before the call - groups set
# on a node outside any tree persist and register when the parent is hosted.
#
# What headless still cannot do: the run uses the dummy rendering driver, so
# nothing is ever drawn. Layout is real and assertable - anchors, offsets,
# position/size, get_global_rect(), container arrangement, theme metrics. Anything
# pixel-dependent is out of scope: screenshots, viewport captures, texture or
# shader output, font rasterization, and anything that reads back rendered image
# data. Test the geometry here; test the pixels against a running game over the
# DevTools bridge.
