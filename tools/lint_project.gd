# Combined linter: UID check, duplicate resource-id check, script compile check,
# and scene configuration warnings for the files under the configured scan_root.
#
# Run headless: godot --headless --path . --script res://tools/lint_project.gd
# With args:    godot --headless --path . --script res://tools/lint_project.gd -- --all --json
#
# Flags (everything after the bare `--` is read via OS.get_cmdline_user_args()):
#   --scene <path>        Lint only this scene (repeatable).
#   --all                 Lint every scene under scan_root (this is the default).
#   --json                Emit the full result dictionary as JSON.
#   --uids-only           Skip the scene-configuration pass.
#   --warnings-only       Skip the UID / duplicate-id pass.
#   --no-shaders          Skip the shader compile pass.
#   --strict              Count warnings towards the exit code.
#   --fail-on-warn        Alias for --strict, kept for older callers.
#   --baseline-write <p>  Write the current finding keys to <p> as JSON, exit 0.
#   --baseline <p>        Compare against a written baseline: findings print as
#                         NEW or PRE-EXISTING, and only NEW ones affect the exit code.
#   --find-orphans        Opt-in heuristic scan for public functions nothing but
#                         the tests calls. Warnings only - never fails the run,
#                         not even under --strict.
#
# Exit codes. This script always calls quit() with its own finding count, so the
# code is the lint verdict and never Godot's shutdown noise about leaked RIDs or
# ObjectDB instances:
#   0  no errors
#   1  lint errors found (or warnings, under --strict)
#   2  the linter could not run: unreadable/invalid config, unopenable scan_root,
#      missing flag argument, or an unreadable/invalid baseline file
#
# Scope rules (applied to every pass):
#   - A directory containing a .gdignore file is skipped, exactly as Godot skips it.
#   - Any res://addons/<name>/ directory containing a plugin.cfg is treated as
#     vendored third-party code and exempted from ALL checks (reported once as
#     `VENDORED (skipped): addons/<name>`) - unless scan_root points inside it,
#     which is an explicit request to lint it.
#
# Script compile check: every discovered .gd is load()ed, which compiles it
# without instantiating (a @tool script's static initializers may still run).
# A script that fails to compile is an ERROR finding, rule `script_parse_failed`:
# lint green now means every script in scope can at least parse, i.e. the project
# can boot. If MANY scripts fail at once, suspect a stale global class cache -
# run `godot --headless --path . --import` before believing the findings.
#
# Global class cache check: every top-level `class_name` in the scanned scripts is
# compared against res://.godot/global_script_class_cache.cfg. Two rules:
#   class_cache_stale    ERROR - a class is declared but the cache does not know
#                        it. This is what produces a flood of `Could not find type
#                        "X" in the current scope` parse errors in files nobody
#                        touched, so it prints FIRST, above the compile results it
#                        explains. Fix: godot --headless --path . --import
#   class_cache_missing  advisory - no cache file at all (a fresh clone that has
#                        never been imported). Reported once, not once per class:
#                        that is one condition, not N findings.
#
# Shader compile check, rules `shader_compile_failed` (a .gdshader file) and
# `shader_embedded_compile_failed` (a Shader stored inside a .tres). A broken
# shader is a runtime-only failure: nothing else in this harness sees it, the
# scene it is attached to loads fine, and the game renders the fallback magenta
# only when that scene is on screen.
#
# How it detects failure, and why it is not the obvious way: `load()` on an
# unparseable shader still returns a Shader object, exactly like `load()` on an
# unparseable script - so load success proves nothing. Instead a sentinel uniform
# is appended to the source and the code is assigned to a bare Shader. Assigning
# `Shader.code` runs the real ShaderLanguage parser even under --headless (the
# dummy rendering driver still reports `Shader compilation failed`), and
# RenderingServer.get_shader_parameter_list() then returns [] for a shader that
# did not compile. The sentinel coming back is the pass signal. No SubViewport,
# no node, and no render is needed - if the sentinel name already occurs in the
# source it is suffixed until unique, so a shader cannot collide its way green.
#
# `#include` of a .gdshaderinc resolves normally from raw source, so an error
# inside an include is caught through its includers. The .gdshaderinc files
# themselves declare no shader_type and cannot compile standalone: they are
# counted and reported as skipped, never as passed. Shaders embedded in a .tscn
# are NOT covered - only .gdshader files and .tres resources.
#
# String-literal reference check, rule `string_ref_unresolved`: the name inside
# has_method("x") / has_signal("x") / emit_signal("x") / call("x") /
# call_deferred("x") / connect("x", ...) is flagged when no `func x` and no
# `signal x` exists anywhere in the project and ClassDB knows no such engine
# member. Advisory - a text scan cannot see a name built at runtime, so it must
# never gate a run.
#
# NodePath findings come in three rules:
#   nodepath_unresolved       ERROR - the path stays inside nodes this .tscn
#                             declares and lands nowhere: a real dangling path.
#   nodepath_crosses_instance advisory - the path enters an instanced sub-scene,
#                             whose internals a static pass cannot see. Reported,
#                             never counted, not even under --strict.
#   nodepath_empty            warning - a NodePath-like property left empty.
#
# Baseline workflow - two commands, no git shell-out, so it cannot hang:
#   1. at the merge-base:  godot ... lint_project.gd -- --baseline-write lint_baseline.json
#   2. on the working tree: godot ... lint_project.gd -- --baseline lint_baseline.json
# A finding key is "file|rule|subject" and deliberately carries no line numbers,
# so a finding survives an unrelated edit to the same file.
#
# Windows note: the plain (non-console) Godot .exe writes nothing to a PowerShell
# console. Redirect to a file and read it back. Every line this script emits goes
# to stdout via print(), so one redirect captures the whole report.

# --- Unresolved string-literal references (G-098) ---
# An orchestrator pinned a panel API in prose: one agent wrote has_method("open"),

# the tests connects a string literal in one file to a function name in another,
# so the seam held green until the game ran.
#
# This is the _find_orphans scan pointed the other way: instead of declarations
# nobody references, references that declare nowhere. Always on (not behind
# --find-orphans) because the entire failure mode is that nobody knew to look.
#
# Severity is ADVISORY, deliberately, and the honest reason is `call`: a Callable
# invoked as `cb.call("player")` passes a data string, not a method name, and no
# text scan can tell that from `obj.call("player")`. A noisy new ERROR would teach
# projects to stop reading lint output, which is worse than the gap; an advisory
# that names a real broken seam costs one line.
#
# Residual false-positive sources, after comment stripping and the ClassDB lookup:
#   - `call("literal")` on a Callable, as above - the one that cannot be fixed.
#   - members of a GDExtension or C# class. ClassDB carries a GDExtension class
#     only once the extension is loaded, which a `--script` run may not do.
#   - built-in Variant-type methods (Array.append, String.split, Callable.bind),
#     which live outside ClassDB entirely.
# Names built by concatenation or held in variables simply do not match: no
# finding, no crash, and no claim that they were checked.
#
# Skipped as call SITES (never as declaration sources): the uid_check_ignore
