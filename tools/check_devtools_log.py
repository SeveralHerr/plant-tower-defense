"""Claude Code `Stop` hook: keep the devtools gaps log honest.

Installed by `/scaffold-godot-harness`. On every Stop event it asks one question:
did this session touch Godot code without adding an entry to `log-devtools.md`?
If so it prints a `systemMessage` reminder. It is **advisory by default** — it
warns, it does not fail or restart the turn.

Why a hook at all: the "append a gap entry every response" convention is a
prompt-level instruction with no enforcement, so it silently decays. The hook is
the only part of the loop that cannot forget.

**What counts as compliance.** An entry dated today — a `## ` heading containing
today's date, which is the format the log's own Format section prescribes —
carrying a `Value:` verdict:

    ## 2026-08-01 — Added the ore-tier chain

    - Value: **overkill** — a data-only change with nothing to observe at runtime.

Until 0.5.0 this only checked whether the log file showed up in `git status`, so
*any* byte-level change satisfied it: a stray whitespace edit passed, and so did
a log whose newest entry was three weeks old. That is precisely the decay this
hook exists to prevent, so the check now reads the file rather than its git
status. Set `log_check_dated_entry` to false to fall back to the old behavior.

**Why the `Value:` line is checked too** (0.7.0+). The gaps half of the log can
only ever ask for more harness; it has no way to record that a task did not need
the tool. The `Value:` verdict is the half that can, which makes it the half a
session under time pressure quietly drops — and its absence is invisible, because
a log full of gap entries looks diligent. Set `log_check_value` to false to
require only a dated entry.

Config (all optional) is read from `addons/godot_selftest/devtools_config.json`:

    "log_files":              ["log-devtools.md"]  # files that must be updated alongside code
    "log_check_globs":        []                   # extra path substrings counted as "code"
    "log_check_block":        false                # true -> block the Stop instead of warning
    "log_check_dated_entry":  true                 # false -> only require the file to change
    "log_check_value":        true                 # false -> don't require a Value: verdict

Set `log_check_block` to true only if the advisory reminder proves easy to ignore;
a blocking Stop hook forces the model to continue the turn, which costs a round trip
every time it fires.

Exit code is always 0 — a broken reminder must never break a session.
