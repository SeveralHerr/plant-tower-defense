"""import_check.py - run Godot's `--import` and fail when the project no longer parses.

Why this exists: `godot --headless --path . --import` exits 0 whether or not the
scripts it just re-scanned actually compile. A real run looked like this --

    import exit=0
    SCRIPT ERROR: Parse Error: Cannot infer the type of "walk" variable
       at: GDScript::reload (res://player/player.gd:446)
    ERROR: Failed to load script "res://items/items.gd" with error "Parse error".

-- so "the class cache was regenerated" and "the project still parses" are the same
exit code, and a broken game reports as a clean import. The parse errors are printed,
never returned; nothing downstream of the exit code can see them.

The failure is worst in exactly the case `--import` is run for: a `class_name` that
arrived from a rebase, a pull or a branch switch. One missing entry in
`.godot/global_script_class_cache.cfg` cascades into every file that names the type,
and the tool you ran to fix it told you it had succeeded.

So this wrapper runs the same import, captures stdout and stderr to `.gates/import.log`,
and scans that log for the signals Godot only ever prints on a real failure. Findings
are quoted back, not counted, so the terminal output is enough to act on.

Exit codes follow the harness convention (`lint_project.gd`, `run_tests.gd`):
    0  the import ran AND the captured output is clean
    1  the import ran but the output contains parse / load errors  <- the whole point
    2  could not run at all: no Godot binary, no project.godot, no output captured,
       Godot crashed, or the import timed out

Usage:
    python tools/import_check.py                       # import the project in .
    python tools/import_check.py -p ../other-game
    python tools/import_check.py --godot /path/to/godot
    python tools/import_check.py --json                # machine-readable verdict

(`python` on Windows -- `python3` there is a Microsoft Store alias stub that satisfies
`command -v` and then refuses to run.)
