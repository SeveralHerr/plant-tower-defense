"""
devtools.py - Generic CLI for interacting with a running Godot instance via the
godot-selftest-harness DevTools autoload.

Commands are written as JSON to user://devtools_commands.json and results are
read back from user://devtools_results.json. The DevTools autoload polls for
commands and writes results. This client is completely game-agnostic: it ships
only the generic verbs the harness core registers, plus two escape hatches
(`cmd` and `list-commands`) so any project-registered verb is reachable without
editing this file.

Usage:
    python3 tools/devtools.py ping                     # Check if game is running
    python3 tools/devtools.py screenshot               # Capture screenshot
    python3 tools/devtools.py validate-all             # Validate all scenes
    python3 tools/devtools.py scene-tree               # Get node hierarchy
    python3 tools/devtools.py performance              # Get FPS, memory, etc.
    python3 tools/devtools.py get-state --node "/root/Main/Player"
    python3 tools/devtools.py get-state --node "/root/Main/HUD" --property visible --property size
    python3 tools/devtools.py set-state --node "/root/Main/Player" --property health --value 100
    python3 tools/devtools.py step-time --seconds 0.3   # Advance the paused tree
    python3 tools/devtools.py step-time --seconds 2 --hold move_left
    python3 tools/devtools.py touch press --index 0 --pos 640,360
    python3 tools/devtools.py key E                     # Raw keyboard event
    python3 tools/devtools.py input state               # Pressed/strength per action
    python3 tools/devtools.py tilemap-cells --node /root/Main/TileMap --rect 0,0,16,16
    python3 tools/devtools.py tilemap-region --node /root/Main/TileMap --atlas 3,1
    python3 tools/devtools.py scripts-seen              # Script census since launch
    python3 tools/devtools.py launch --isolated         # Start the game detached
    python3 tools/devtools.py set-feature --touchscreen true
    python3 tools/devtools.py --json ping               # Any verb, raw reply JSON
    python3 tools/devtools.py list-commands            # Discover all registered verbs
    python3 tools/devtools.py harness-version          # Which harness revision is installed
    python3 tools/devtools.py cmd my_project_verb --args '{"foo": 1}'
    python3 tools/devtools.py quit

Project selection:
    Run from the project root or pass --project/-p <path>.

Liveness precheck:
    The DevTools autoload deletes the command file the moment it picks it up, so
    a command file that is still on disk a couple of seconds later means nothing
    is polling that directory. Every command therefore fails fast with
    "game not running" instead of blocking for the full timeout. Pass
    --no-precheck to disable it.

Concurrency:
    The bridge is a single command/result file pair, so it is still one in-flight
    command at a time. Each request now carries a unique "id" and the client
    refuses to return a reply stamped with somebody else's id, which turns a
    crossed reply from silent data corruption into a clear error.

    For genuinely parallel work, give each instance its own bus with --session:

        godot --path . -- --devtools-session a &
        python3 tools/devtools.py --session a ping

    The id is spliced into the bus filenames (devtools_commands_a.json, ...), so
    N instances can share one user:// dir without answering each other's
    commands. Without a session the filenames are unchanged, so nothing about
    existing usage moves.

    `launch --isolated` also gives the instance its own bus DIRECTORY, passed as
    `-- --devtools-busdir <dir>`, and proves the bus answers before printing the
    follow-up command. What it still does NOT do is move user:// - Godot resolves
    that inside the engine and honours no flag or environment variable for it, so
    screenshots, saves and UI baselines stay shared. `ping` reports bus_dir and
    user_dir separately so the difference is a read, not a promise.

User data path resolution (highest priority first):
    1. --userdata <path>                                (global CLI flag)
    2. GODOT_USERDATA environment variable
    3. project.godot: application/config/use_custom_user_dir +
       application/config/custom_user_dir_name
    4. Per-platform default: <data dir>/Godot|godot/app_userdata/<config name>

    sending an extra ping.

    ONE exception, and it is not an edge case (H-038): since the re-entrancy guard
    landed, a game that is polling normally deliberately leaves the command file on
    disk while a handler is in flight, and picks it up on the tick after that handler
    returns. `step_time 5s` followed by anything else hits this every time. The
    breadcrumb plus a fresh heartbeat is the discriminator (see _handler_in_flight),
    so "file still here AND a live game is inside a handler" means alive and busy,
    not dead, and the wait belongs to the caller's timeout budget rather than to this
    2s liveness grace.

    Godot binary resolution: --godot flag -> $GODOT_BIN -> the config's
    `godot_bin` key. stdout/stderr are redirected to files, NEVER
    subprocess.PIPE - an unread pipe fills and stalls Godot on Windows.

    --isolated gives the new instance its own session id AND its own bus
    directory (passed as `-- --devtools-busdir <dir>`, which the autoload
    honours), then proves the bus answers before printing the follow-up command.

    What --isolated does NOT do: move user:// itself. Godot resolves that inside
    the engine and has no switch for it, so saves, screenshots and baselines are
    still shared. The previous version printed a temp `userdata:` path as though
    it had moved them; nothing ever wrote there, and the follow-up command it
    printed failed with `game not running` (gather:G-091/G-111/G-115). The claim
    is now exactly as large as the behaviour.

    Everything after a bare `--` is forwarded to the Godot command line, so a run
    needing an engine flag (`--write-movie out/frame.png --fixed-fps 30`) no
